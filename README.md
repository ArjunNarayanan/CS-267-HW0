# Homework 0 - CS 267 - Applications of Parallel Computers - Arjun Narayanan
## My Bio
My academic and professional interests are broadly in the field of simulation and scientific computing. I developed an interest in this field during my masters in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Stanford University. I took courses on mechanics (solids and fluids), numerical methods (finite difference, explicit/implicit schemes), and the finite element method. For my research, I implemented an isogeometric finite element method which uses Bezier basis functions, and applied it to study high order PDEs of non-linear elasticity arising from higher-gradient formulaitons. Subsequently, I worked at Siemens Corporate Technology (2016-2017) as a research engineer. I used simulation to improve product design of next generation gas-turbines, turbogenerators, and electric drives. I also implemented multi-scale analysis methods to aid with Design for Additive Manufacturing.

I am a PhD student in the department of Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley. I develop finite element methods to study solid-solid phase transformations that are relevant to geophysics. Through CS 267, I want to learn how I can reduce the compute time of my finite element simulations. I am also interested in computational geometry and would like to learn parallel algorithms that will be relevant to this field.
